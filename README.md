# Business-Reports

These are some of the reports that I developed during my time with the Greater Memphis Chamber. All of these reports were created using Economic Data Analytics tools like Burning Glass, EMSI, and FRED. The data was pulled into excel files which were then used to create the visualization, which allowed me to create PowerPoint pdf deliverables. In short, each deliverable provides an overview of the historical nature of each job sector within the Memphis MSA, highlights some of the noteworthy descriptive statistics, and proivdes an outlook on the forecasted future in the greater Memphis area.
